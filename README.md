# Keybind Display (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you wish you could change that 'SHIFT-6' keybind to show as 'Sh-6' instead of 'S6' that ElvUI displays?**  
**What about when you setup 2 keybinds for a button and it always shows that one keybind but rather it show the other instead?**
**Have you ever wondered why the keybind gets truncated when there is still plenty of room on the button for the text?**

### Well now you are able to address these with this AddOn that is an ElvUI Plugin.
