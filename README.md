# Keybind Display (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you wish you could change that 'SHIFT-6' keybind to show as 'Sh-6' instead of 'S6' that ElvUI displays?**  
**What about when you setup 2 keybinds for a button and it always shows that one keybind but rather it show the other instead?**
**Have you ever wondered why the keybind gets truncated when there is still plenty of room on the button for the text?**

### Well now you are able to address these with this AddOn that is an ElvUI Plugin.

## Keybind Display (ElvUI Plugin) Key Features
- Ability to add color to the text (example: N2 with the N as red; |cffFF0000N|r2)
- Ability to search and replace keybind text
- Ability to set which keybind to display if you have more than one set for a button
- Ability to allow the keybind text to use the whole width of the button to display the text instead of being truncated
